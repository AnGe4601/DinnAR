__Contributions:__

**Lakshmi Iyer (25%)**
- Completed Login and Registration screens and successfully integrated with Firebase Authentication, allowing users to create new accounts and log in with an existing account. Also have implemented input validation/error handling for missing fields, bad email or phone number formats, and any mismatch between password and password confirmation fields.  Minor tweaks need to be made to reflect design updates. Need to incorporate password resetting with  “Forgot Password” feature.
- README.file 
- Completed a portion of Settings Screen, lacks functionality and will need to incorporate camera/location access toggling.
  
**Yingchen (Angela) Liu (25%)**
- Completed all Preferences Screen (Cuisine, Type of Restaurant, Restaurant within Distance/Proximity and Dietary Restriction), including its initial loading screen functionality, and all UI elements. Some minor tweaks of the UI might need to be addressed after coordinating with UX designer (Tanya). Storing the input data will also need to be implemented at the next stage
- Experiment with the AR feature
    
**Swathi Rudravajjala (25%)**

__Deviations:__
- Planned to enable camera and location permissions, but have not reached that stage of development yet. This will be completed for the beta release. 
- Planned to include actual menus and coupons, but did not have the sample data. Will be populated for beta release
- Planned to use scroll views to scroll through recommendations. Will implement during beta release once we have more data to work with
